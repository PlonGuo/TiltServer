# Slippy Map Server - Snowmap Interview Assignment
Being a developer at a startup means venturing into the unknown and learning quickly. This assessment is designed to evaluate your problem-solving skills when tackling an unfamiliar challenge.

## Overview
In this assessment, you will implement a simple service to extract map tiles from a geospatial raster dataset and serve them as PNG images. Tiles are generated based on coordinates (```x, y, z```)â€”representing horizontal index, vertical index, and zoom level, respectively. Your solution will process a provided GeoTIFF file and return 256x256 PNG tiles via a local web server. You may use any programming language of your choice.

- [Slippy Map Tile Naming (OpenStreetMap)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames)

### Provided Resources
- A TIFF file as the source for tile generation: ```snowdepth.tiff```
- A mapbox implementation in ```mapbox/src/App.js``` with an Snowmap tile server

### Objective
1. Create a web service that extracts tiles from ```snowdepth.tiff``` based on tile coordinates(```x, y, z```)
2. Serve the tiles as PNG images over HTTP
3. Run the service on localhost - no deployment is required
4. Replace the tile layer in ```App.js``` with your own implementation

### Expectations
- Your implementation supports dynamic image generation - meaning it works with any given tiff file.
- You are encouraged to use any tools, libraries, or frameworks that help achieve the goal, make sure you includehow  references.
- The final solution should be well-structured and documented.
- You DO NOT need to deploy the server; running it on `localhost` is sufficient

## Getting Started with the enviroment

To set up the mapbox environment we have provided, run the following commands:
```
cd mapbox
npm install
npm start
```

Once the setup completes successfully, a map should appear in your browser. 

Your task is to replace the server that provides tiles on the map with your own localhost server URL.

## Deliverables
### Code Submission:

- Push your implementation to a public GitHub repository.
- Update this ```README.md``` with setup and usage instructions.

### Demo Video:

- Record a short video (screen recording) demonstrating your server in action.
- Upload it to a platform like YouTube (unlisted) or Google Drive and share the link.

### Submit your work:

- Email the GitHub repository link along with the demo video link.

## Implementation Details

This implementation uses Python Flask for the backend server and Next.js with Mapbox GL for the frontend. The server processes GeoTIFF files and serves map tiles in real-time.

### Prerequisites 

**Backend Dependencies:**
```
Python 3.8+
pip
```

**Frontend Dependencies:**
```
Node.js 18+
pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PlonGuo/TiltServer.git
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd mapbox
pnpm install
```

### Running the Server

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
# From the backend directory, with venv activated
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python server.py
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
# From another terminal, in the mapbox directory
pnpm dev
```

### API Endpoints

The server provides the following endpoint:

- `GET /tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}` - Returns a 256x256 PNG tile for the specified coordinates
  - `z`: zoom level
  - `x`: tile x coordinate
  - `y`: tile y coordinate

### Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Backend Server (Python/Flask)**
   - Handles tile requests
   - Processes GeoTIFF data using rasterio
   - Generates PNG tiles
   - Implements CORS for frontend access

2. **Frontend (Next.js/Mapbox)**
   - Uses Next.js 13+ with App Router
   - Implements client-side rendering for Mapbox
   - Displays the interactive map
   - Handles user interaction

### Libraries Used

- **Backend:**
  - Flask: Web framework
  - rasterio: GeoTIFF processing
  - Pillow: Image processing
  - mercantile: Tile coordinate calculations
  - flask-cors: Cross-origin resource sharing

- **Frontend:**
  - Next.js: React framework
  - Mapbox GL JS: Map rendering
  - Tailwind CSS: Styling
